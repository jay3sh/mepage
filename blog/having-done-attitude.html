    <h1>The &quot;Having done&quot; attitude</h1>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU">TED talk</a> on Procrastination
Tim Urban mentioned how he got excited when TED invited him to do a talk.
He said he had always wanted to talk on TED. But he realized that he wanted to
&quot;have done&quot; a TED talk rather than actually do all the work for a TED talk.</p>

<p>After a few days I came across the same idea in Nassim Taleb&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/0812979680">Antifragile</a>.
Here&#39;s a footnote from his book.</p>

<blockquote><p>A friend who writes books remarked that painters like painting, but authors
like &quot;having written&quot;. I suggested he stop writing, for his sake and the
sake of his readers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve started introspecting my hobbies and work from this point of view. Do I
actually like reading books or do I like having read the books? Do I actually
like playing Portal or do I like having finished it? Do I actually like
climbing difficult routes or do I just want to have done a 5.10d on lead?
Do I actually like coding my software or is my goal only to have finished
building the product? Do I want to build a meaningful business or do I
want to have had a successful acquisition?</p>

<p>From whatever finishes I&#39;ve had in the past, any feeling of achievement or
sense of completion I&#39;ve received has felt much hollower than the joy of doing
the activity.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a necessary question to ask when pursuing one&#39;s hobbies or
passions in life. What&#39;s the real underlying motivation? Is it enjoying the
experience of having done the activity or is it having finished the activity?</p>
