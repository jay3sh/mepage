Coding in Mind
===

Some of us do it sometimes - automatically, unknowingly - when we are deeply engrossed in our projects. But it's an activity worth doing deliberately and regularly. It's immensely helpful when it comes to debugging your code or making design decisions about its architecture. Moreover it's an activity akin to Meditation which brings calm to your mind, as explained with the theory of Flow (or Optimal experience).

Seeing the structure of your code in your mind's eye is more important than seeing it in the code editor.
