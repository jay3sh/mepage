Some-Profit Business Models
===

Today's capitalist business world has seen examples of companies who desperately seek a competitive advantage (esp in cutting edge technology) and exploit that to the fullest to maximize their profit or market share, leading to virtual monopoly. This behavior also leads to wealth polarization and income inequality. The for-profit companies are only about profit. The for profit organizations do not turn out to be good for the market or its customers, because a monopolized market becomes stagnant sooner or later.

The non-profit comapnies are mainly philanthropic or charity organizations, which rely on donations. Although this is noble goal, it does not appeal to enterpreneurs who have competitive nature and would like to win rewards for their initiative and/or insight and/or hardwork. Non-profit organizations are completely beneficial to their customers (in case of charities those are beneficiaries, in case of open source software those are the end users of the software).

The for-profit and non-profit represent extreme positions on ethics and incentives.

Therefore we need to build new companies with a medium stance. I call them some-profit companies.

The some-profit company's goal is to build sustainable business model, but not exploit any fortuitous opportunity to establish a locked eco system that will lead to monopoly.
