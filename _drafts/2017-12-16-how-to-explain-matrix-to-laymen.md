How to explain Matrix to Laymen
===

By "Matrix" I mean both the movie and the mathematical concept of transformation matrix.

I've watched 'Matrix' the movie (the first one), a number of times and it always fascinates me as I try to understand its concepts at different levels of abstractions. I've also done a fair share of 2d and 3d graphics programming, hence dealing with transfomation matrices in the process.

The movie deserves so much credit, because it has created a beautiful and dramatic work of art out of a mathematical concept of Matrix. It has taken its abstract meaning and tried to apply it to reality. Thus allowing the laypeople a glimpse of an important mathematical artifact.

Yet, not everyone may appreciate the concept. They may get enchanted by the action choreography and stunning visual effects, but may soon get disinterested in the theory and concept of the story.

I remember when I was working on a 2D graphics program and struggling with getting the right transformation matrix. When I realized that the translation should be negative, instead of positive and scale terms should be reciprocals; because the matrix I was dealing with was on the view and not on the object, it was a stunning realization. Such epiphanic moments remind you the power of the concept of matrix.
