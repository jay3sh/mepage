"Troy"
===
Liked this quote from Troy. As Achilles says:  
"I'll tell you a secret......something they don't teach you in your temple. The gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal. Because any moment might be our last. Everything's more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again. "
