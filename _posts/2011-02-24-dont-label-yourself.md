Don't label yourself
===
Don't call yourself a CEO - You'll find excuse to not write code.  
Don't call yourself a CTO - You might overlook a potential market.  
Don't call yourself a Coder - You just might forget what your users want.  
Don't call yourself a Designer - You'll shy away from that little hack to improve the performance ten folds  
Don't call yourself a Tester - You can't be one without also being other things  
  
The moment you put a label on yourself, you tend do things that others with the same label do.  
  
Go do what you feel like doing when you wake up in the morning and let it label you.
