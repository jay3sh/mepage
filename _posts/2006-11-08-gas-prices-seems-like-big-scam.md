"Gas prices... seems like big scam"
===
I told my friends last weekend that I am gonna fill my tank on the day before election, to avoid the gas price hike that will follow once elections get over. I was little serious though at the back of my mind. But I did fill my tanks on Monday.  
  
I was astonished to watch the gas price change on election day however. In the morning I saw the rate of $2.07 per gallon. It did not wait even for the last voter to cast his vote before rising to $2.29 in the evening. I was dumbfounded. Moreover I don't see this as a news this morning. I searched google news for gas prices, but no one seems to register this fact. There are news that industry rate will go by 4 cents or something in some parts. What I observed was a quarter per gallon. By filling in 10 gallons of Monday I saved $2.5\. Are the local gas station owners hiking the prices on their own? Who knows!?  
  
Anyway I am glad I verified my theory (and saved couple bucks too).
