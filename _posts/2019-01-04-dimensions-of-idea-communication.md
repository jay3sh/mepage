Dimensions of Idea communication
===

**Books** are one dimensional. Writer has to serialize his ideas in a string of words

**Pictures** are two dimensional. Painter or Photographer communicates his idea by puttings colors on a flat canvas.

**Movies** are three dimensional. Director communicates his idea via a stream of images (or four dimensional if you count sound)

**Games** can have any number of dimensions. The communication of idea is not just one way, but it's a back-n-forth interaction between the world of the game and the player. It's a limitless medium that can be used to communicated very complex ideas.
