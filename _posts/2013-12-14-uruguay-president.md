Uruguay's President
===
Some snippets from this [great news story about Uruguay's President](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/uruguay-president-jose-mujica?CMP=twt_gu)

    "I'm not the poorest president. The poorest is the one who needs a lot to live," he said. 
    "My lifestyle is a consequence of my wounds. I'm the son of my history. There have been years when 
    I would have been happy just to have a mattress."
    
    "My country is not particularly open. These measures are logical," he said. 
    "With marijuana, this is not about being more liberal. We want to take users away from 
    clandestine dealers. 
    
    But we will also restrict their right to smoke if they exceed sensible amounts of consumption. 
    It is like alcohol. If you drink a bottle of whisky a day, then you should be treated as a 
    sick person."
    
    "Contemporary politics is all about short-term pragmatism. We have abandoned religion and 
    philosophy â€¦ What we have left is the automatisation of doing what the market tells us."
