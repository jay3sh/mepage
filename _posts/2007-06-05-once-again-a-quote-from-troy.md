"Once again... a quote from 'Troy'"
===
Everytime I watch Troy, I find some dialog worth blogging....  
  
This one is from Achilles mother Thetis to him when he is deciding to leave for Troy...  
  
"If you stay in Larisa......you will find peace.  
  
You will find a wonderful woman.  
  
You will have sons and daughters,and they will have children. And they will love you.  
When you are gone,they will remember you.  
  
But when your children are dead and their children after them...  
...your name will be lost.  
  
  
  
If you go to Troy......glory will be yours.  
  
They will write stories about your  
victories for thousands of years.  
  
The world will remember your name.  
  
But if you go to Troy......you will never come home.  
  
For your glory walks hand in hand with your doom.  
  
And I shall never see you again."
