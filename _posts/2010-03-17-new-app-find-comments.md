"New app "Find Comments""
===
Over the weekend I found a simple API from [ContextVoice][0]. It was something I was looking for a long time. A service that when given a URL of a news story, returns reader comments from all over the web.  
  
It didn't take long to put together a simple app around this API.  

  
FindComments is really simple.

1) Install app  
1.1) Do NOT look for a new icon in the launcher. You won't find it.  
2) Browse any news story or blog post in the browser.  
3) Press Menu \> Share Page  
4) Press "Find Comments"  
  
Voila!  
  
Available in [Android Market][2], [AndAppStore][3], [Slideme][4].  
  
Here are screenshots. Give it a spin.

ReaderScope users, give it a try. Would you like to see this integrated tightly with ReaderScope?
