As the economics is known as "The Miserable Science", software engineering should be known as "The Doomed Discipline", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory. Software engineering, of course, presents itself as another worthy cause, but that is eyewash: if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do, you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter "How to program if you cannot" ....

From there it is only a small step to measuring "programmer productivity" in terms of "number of lines of code produced per month"....  
>   
> ... Unfathomed misunderstanding is further revealed by the term "software maintenance", as a result of which many people continue to believe that programs - and even programming languages themselves - are subject to wear and tear....
