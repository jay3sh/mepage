"Wifi and Battery"
===
Although I didn't dedicate a blog post to my latest beloved gadget purchase - I have been a happy owner of HTC magic for about three weeks now. I used it for first two weeks with the factory ROM. It worked quite well - except for the Google apps and access to Android market. To my delight I found that it had very good battery life. After around 6-7 hours away from the USB charger, it would loose 10-15% battery. Remembering people's experiences of 24-hr battery life, this seemed quite impressive. However to my annoyance, I found a problem. When the phone was not in use, its wifi would be off. I had ReaderScope on it downloading news every 1 hr. It cancelled the downloads because it didn't find any wifi (and I had set it to use wifi only). Moreover, some apps (which I never found out) would go over the Mobile network if they didn't find wifi. I use a prepaid SIM card. So after every usage of Mobile network, I get a message showing me how much credit was used in last call and what's the balance remaining. So after leaving phone unused for the night, I would find some of these messages in the morning. Using Rs. 0.30 to 9.00 at times. This really bugged me. Loosing money for no reason.  
  
Last week I rooted the phone and installed a different ROM (Amon\_RA), the one with all the good stuff (Google apps and access to market). With this ROM, I do not see the wifi getting turned off when the phone is not in use and the screen is off. The ReaderScope periodic downloads go on without any problem over wifi. However now the battery life has much deteriorated. Over night, when the phone is not hooked to a USB charger, it looses about 40-50% or more charge.  
  
My conclusion, always ON wifi is sipping the juice out of battery.  
  
What I find more interesting however, is HTC's default setting to turn off the wifi when device is unused and screen times out. (And I couldn't find any way to change that setting at all.)  
  
I wonder if they had a noble motive of giving the user longer battery life OR was it to boost revenue of Airtel (partner carrier) by favoring Mobile traffic over Wifi, even when the later is available.  
  
Anyhow... Glad to be with the new ROM!!
