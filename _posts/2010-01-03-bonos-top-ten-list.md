Bono's top ten list
===
I just came across this op-ed piece by Bono for NY Times via my Twitter stream. It has so many quotable quotes that a simple retweet won't justify how much I enjoyed it. I would dare say this list is most interesting of the top-ten lists I have read during this turn of the decade. It includes topics from Social-Political solutions in Africa to Teleportation to Piracy to sexy cars.  
  
Here are my favorite quotes, but I would hate it if you read them out of context, so read the [full article][0] too if you have time.  

> It hurts me to say this about democracy (and I know because my band is one), but rarely does majority rule produce something of beauty.  
> 

- On designing sexy cars. This has been said many times, but still many don't get it.  

> The only thing protecting the movie and TV industries from the fate that has befallen music and indeed the newspaper business is the size of the files.  
> 

- On piracy. I don't fully agree with the rest of Bono's comments in the same section though.    

> By this accounting, your average Ethiopian can sell her underpolluting ways (people in Ethiopia emit about 0.1 ton of carbon a year) to the average American (about 20 tons a year) and use the proceeds to deal with the effects of climate change (like drought), educate her kids and send them to university  
> 

- On global warming. This is one fresh thought I've heard on the matter.   

> ... if there's a breakthrough in the Mideast peace process. The idea is an arts festival that celebrates the origin of the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Every year it could be held in a different location; Jerusalem would obviously be the best place to start.  
> 

- On peace solutions in Middle east. Again very fresh thought.
