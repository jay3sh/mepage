Why gamers like pixelated games
===

Many gamers enjoy games with retro graphics that are characterized by low resolution, pixelated, 8-bit graphics. One main reason for this enjoyment might be the nostalgia for games from their childhood. But there's more at play.

The restrictions on the resolution of such graphics doesn't allow them to imitate the real object as-is. Therefore the result is an abstract low resolution representation. It allows the players to see things that resemble objects in nature, but far from imitate them. That's why when the animation of the the pixelated sprite reminds them of the corresponding action of the object in reality, they find it very funny or interesting.
