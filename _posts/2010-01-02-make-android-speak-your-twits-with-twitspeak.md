Make Android speak your Twits with "TwitSpeak"
===
Happy New Year All.  
  
I thought what could be a better way to wish Happy New Year than to release a new Android app ... and make the source open.

So here is a fun little app **TwitSpeak**.  
  
Just tap the icon and it will read your latest twit to you. How's that? Give it a shot.  
  
And as I said, the complete source code of the app is out in the open, under Android's favorite licese APL 2.0\.

(Tip for developers: If you were looking forward to integrating Twitter in your app and found the OAuth tricky to implement, you have ready to use code now. and it is under APL 2.0\. Go, grab it).  
  
You can get it from Android Market or get the [apk][2].
