Are you the Matt Damon of your game?
===
This is generally a technical blog, but some observations, although non-technical, are too interesting to not write about. I love Hollywood movies and I like Matt Damon ones a lot. Until last night however I didn't realize the most interesting pattern in the roles Matt Damon has portrayed over the years. It struck me after I watched Rounders last night.  
  
Count the number of movies in which Matt Damon has played a character who is the absolute genius of his field. Here is a list.  

1. **Good Will Hunting** A Math Prodigy
2. **The Rainmaker** A talented lawyer who wins his first case barely out of the law school and against a behemoth Insurance company.
3. **Rounders** A genius poker player
4. **The Talented Mr. Ripley** A murderer who is unusually talented in covering his tracks
5. **The Legend of Bagger Vance** A prodigy Golf player
6. **The Bourne {Identity, Supremacy, Ultimatum}** A one of a kind CIA operative who is absolutely unbeatableHe has a thing about playing a genius, doesn't he? And no doubt he is very good at it too. All his characters are thoroughly entertaining and deeply inspirational at the same time.  
  
Hoping to see his latest movie soon - **Green zone**.
