"ReaderScope beta1 is out"
===
Just published beta1 of my second Android app - ReaderScope. It's a Google Reader client for Android.  
  
The goal is to develop simple android-native interface for accessing Google Reader. ReaderScope just takes your credentials (login takes place over secure http connection), fetches the data from your Google Reader account and presents it using Android's native GUI elements. Check out the screenshots below. You can also download your favorite feeds in bulk and then read them offline.  
  
  
  
At present the news items are displayed in text-only format. This minimal approach is suitable for a phone. However, an option to display images is also in the works.  
  
Give it a spin and let me know what you think. You can post it in comments here, or tweet them to me (@jyro) or I can check your market comments via cyrket.
