"Indirect experiments"
===
I like how some advanced experiments in science are fantastically indirect. Take for example this experiment of measuring mass of proton ([source][0]).  
  

> For each hydrogen atom, the team replaced the atom's electron with a particle called a muon, which is 200 times more massive than an electron.

> "Because the muon is so much heavier, it orbits very close to the proton, so it is sensitive to the proton's size," said team member Aldo Antognini, of the Paul-Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.

> Muons are unstable, and they decay into other particles in just 2.2 microseconds. The team knew that firing a laser at the atom before the muon decays should excite the muon, causing it to move to a higher energy level---a higher orbit around the proton. The muon should then release the extra energy as x-rays and move to a lower energy level.

> The distance between these energy levels is determined by the size of the proton, which in turn dictates the frequency of the emitted x-rays.

> But based on the accepted proton radius, the experiment failed to produce x-rays at the anticipated frequency.
