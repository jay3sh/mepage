“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.” - Einstein (possibly misattributed)

This is a sound judgement when talking about real world. Yet, it doesn't apply to the virtual world created by computing devices in past half century. Windows users are quite familiar to the notion of software errors disappearing just by trying the same thing over and over again by restarting the application or even rebooting the machine. It's so common that it's not even funny (or [maybe it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UT8RkSmN4k))
