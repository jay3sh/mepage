"Trip videos"
===
When I was browsing through my camera's memory yesterday, I revisited the videos I had taken during my road trip from MN to CA. Two of them I found worth uploading.  
  
The first one I shot in the evening of second day of my drive. I tried to describe it with words in my last post. Here is how it looked like. But it is still far from the actual experience.  
  
  
  
This one was just something cool to capture in camera.  
  
  
  
Enjoy!
