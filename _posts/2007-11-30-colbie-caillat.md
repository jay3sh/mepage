Colbie Caillat
===
Last month or so I heard "Bubbly" and just loved it. For past week I have been listening to "Realize" and I just adored the way Colbie Caillat can play her voice.  
  
She has great talent and genuine voice. Halfway through "Realize" she just takes her time to play her vocal chords to create magic out of the words "didn't I tell you...".  
  
It's not usual to find someone's live performance as good as their post processed published albums. If you see this live performance by Colbie, you will find an exception to that rule.
