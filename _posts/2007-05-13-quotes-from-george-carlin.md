"quotes from George Carlin"
===
Here is the [original post][0].  
  
And here are the ones I liked very much:  
  
\* Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.  
  
\* I put a dollar in a change machine. Nothing changed.   
  
\* No one knows what's next, but everybody does it.  
  
\* I've never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of Gatorade.   
  
\* So far, this is the oldest I've been.
