"ReaderScope v1.3.3 - offline podcasts"
===
[ReaderScope][0] primarily started as an Android app to access Google Reader from the phone. Over time however, various features were added as they proved complimentary to the act of news reading - like sharing the news with friends (Twitter, SMS, Email); bookmarking it (Del.icio.us); reading what others think about it (Digg, Reddit, FriendFeed); support for rich forms of news, i.e. podcasts and youtube videos, etc.  
  
This release improves one of those fringe features, that of Podcasts. ReaderScope supports scheduled download of news items for reading offline. However that wasn't supported for podcasts yet. This release tries to address that problem a bit.  
  
Now as you click on a podcast beacon, you will be asked whether you want to play the podcast right away or just download it for later listening.

If you choose to download, it will start downloading in the background (with progress in the notification). When the download is complete, you can listen to it by clicking on the notification. You can do this when you are offline too.  
  
Furthermore, you can choose to download multiple podcasts simultaneously. They will download in parallel and will be accessible via their independent notifications.

You can listen to them one by one after they are downloaded. When the podcast ends or if you choose to stop it; the local downloaded file is automatically deleted freeing the storage it occupies.  
  
How do you like it? Let me know.  
  
Also in this release there are some bug fixes. There was a glitch in the Google News and Twitter news features. If you were to sync your feeds with "Thorough" option, the feeds under Google News and Social Channels would disappear. This release fixes that problem.  
  
That's it for now. Upgrade to v1.3.3 and let me know if there's any problem.  
  
Cheers!
