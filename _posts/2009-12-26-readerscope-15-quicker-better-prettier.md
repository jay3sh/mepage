ReaderScope 1.5 - quicker, better, prettier
===
ReaderScope 1.5 is ready for the holidays. With the latest improvements it gives the best Google Reader experience out there for your Android phone.  
  
ReaderScope now uses non-blocking UI and the items are now loaded progressively. What does that mean? See it yourself.  

  
  
  
As you know, the app is free in various markets. The themes (including the 'Santa' theme in above video) are part of a Theme Pack, which can be [purchased][0] for a ONLY $2.49 $3.49  
  
Big thanks to the [beta testers][1] who helped testing the unstable 1.5 builds for over a week. Thank you guys!
