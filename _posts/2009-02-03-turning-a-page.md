Turning a page
===
"...What I think is, it's never  
    too late...or, in my case, too  
    early, to be whoever you want to  
    be...There's no time limit, start  
    anytime you want...change or stay  
    the same...there aren't any  
    rules...We can make the best or  
    worst of it...I hope you make the  
    best...I hope you see things that  
    startle you. Feel things you  
    never felt before. I hope you  
    meet people who have a different  
    point of view. I hope you  
    challenge yourself. I hope you  
    stumble, and pick yourself up. I  
    hope you live the life you wanted  
    to...and if you haven't, I hope  
    you start all over again."

Today was my last day at my [day job][0]. From now on I will be devoting all of my time to my [pet project][1]. I am moving back to my home town Mumbai, after spending 6 wonderful years in US. I will be flying in few hours. Catch you from the other side of the planet!
