Violet end of spectrum
===

For past couple of weeks I'm wearing [these yellow glasses](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000USRG90/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) while working on computer or watching TV. It has some interesting effect - both physically and psychologically.

I read that these glasses filter out the violet end of color spectrum. When you wear them you cannot see blue. If you see a rainbow, you will see black where you are supposed to see blue. They are supposed to reduce the strain on the eyes. I didn't find any solid research that corroborates this, however the theory seemed logical. The energy content of the light (or electromagnetic radiation) increases towards to blue-violet end of spectrum. The ultra-violet rays are not visible to our eyes, but they can burn our skin. So it sounds logical that the blue light entering our eyes may put more strain on them than the light lower in the spectrum (green, yellow, red). In any case, there doesn't seem to be any harm in trying them.

My experience has been positive. I think my eyes do feel physical comfort when I'm wearing these glasses during long hours of computer work. In fact I've found that watching Television shows or movies through these glasses make them look more glamorous. I quite enjoy them.

What I find more interesting though is the reverse effect it has on psychology. As I described above, the blue light is high energy content light, while yellow rays have less energy. However emotionally we percieve blue as calm or soothing color, while yellow as hot or anxious color. When everything looks yellow through these glasses, it feels like the world is on fire all the time. Somewhere in the subconcious it does create an anxious response. The long term usage of these glasses may be beneficial to the physical health of the eye, but what effect will it have on the mind?

For now I'm going to keep on wearing them. Maybe over time I'll get used to the seeing the yellow glow all over and won't associate with heat or tension.
