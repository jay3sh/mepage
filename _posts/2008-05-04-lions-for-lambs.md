Lions for Lambs
===
I watched this movie last night on DVD. It is a must-see if you are/were an idealist. It is a reflection upon the present US war politics. However, the core theme is far reaching.  
  
The story unfolds on three plots in parallel in a duration of 1 hour - a US military mission in Afghanistan, an interview of the US senator with a long-time reporter happening in Washington DC, and a one-on-one discussion between a student and a professor of political science taking place in some west coast university. All three events address the same problem, but it is shocking to see what one hopes in an ideal world, what actually happens in the real world, and how one justifies it in a bureaucratic(!) world.  
  
Every character in these story lines is deep. But all of them have something in common. They all show how a young one starts a career with the fresh ideas in his/her mind and how the harsh reality dries them away. What disturbs is the seeming inevitability of all this.  
  
I think the disillusionment an idealist suffers along the progress of his career is irrespective of the profession. In political or social contexts however they have grave consequences because they can cost people their lives.  
  
... Do watch it if you like thought provoking stories.
