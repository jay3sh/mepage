Firefox 3 is brilliant!!!
===
If you read [this][0] on slashdot this morning you must already know. I just tried it on my Mac OSx and the review is completely true.  
  
Starting firefox 2 on my freshly booted MacBook was taking very very long time. It was unusually slow even after compared to sluggishness of firefox on Linux. Don't know why. So when I tried firefox 3 beta 1 on it I could clearly tell the difference. The fire in firefox is back.  
  
\[The only reason you might want to hold from upgrading just as yet is lack of availability of compatible plugins. As the official release nears, this problem will go away\]
