"Today's slashdot and open source"
===
If you read today's slashdot, you couldn't have missed these two news being posted [one][0] after the [other][1]. It supplements my previous post on open souce.

Two biggies of the industry opening up. Cisco's news isn't that big, these days it doesn't make sense to develop protocol libraries behind high walls anyway. This however shows that the big companies will be seeing the value in open source; or the futility of keeping the source closed.  
  
There is another news on slashdot that is an interesting read: [The Rise of Geekdom][3].  
  
I think the following para from [the article][4] describes the geek phenomenon very well.  
  

> But the biggest change was not Silicon Valley itself. Rather, the new technology created a range of mental playgrounds where the new geeks could display their cultural capital. The jock can shine on the football field, but the geeks can display their supple sensibilities and well-modulated emotions on their Facebook pages, blogs, text messages and Twitter feeds. Now there are armies of designers, researchers, media mavens and other cultural producers with a talent for whimsical self-mockery, arcane social references and late-night analysis.
