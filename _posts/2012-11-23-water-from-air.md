"Water from air"
===
It's fascinating how a really simple idea can change life as we know it. Today I read this [news][0] via slashdot about a new startup [NBD nano][1], that is building a device that can extract water from air. The most interesting part is its implications and applications.

And the underlying technology seems convincing. Amazing stuff!
