"Safari Bookshelf"
===
O'Reilly's Safari bookshelf is a great aid for people learning computer programming/ network administration. You can seach through their database of books to find the book that you want and if the preview of the book's chapters looks like what you are interested in, then add this book to your bookshelf to have full access to it. You can fill your bookshelf with such books. There is a limit on the size of bookshelf and it is proportional to the subscription fee. They have 14 day trial period as well if you want to try.  
  
I started using it from yesterday and I must say it is very useful. Currently I am trying to learn about linux networking tools. Oreilly has THE useful books for learning such stuff and as you read through chapters the cross reference links they suggest under 'Additional Reading' give you wholesome learning experience.  
  
This is worth the money. It gives 5 slot bookshelf for 10$ a month. The only catch is you cannot replace a book on the shelf until 30 days. But I feel that's fair game. The quality of Oreilly books is worth the cost of this tool.  
  
I think this is an innovative example of how a modern library or an online book store should be.
