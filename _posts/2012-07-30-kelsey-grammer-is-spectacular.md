"Kelsey Grammer is spectacular"
===
After watching 11 seasons of [Frasier][0], I couldn't imagine [Kelsey Grammer][1] could be anyone but a comedian. When I watched [Boss][2] I was glad to be wrong. The character of Tom Kane is as diametrically opposite of Frasier as possible and Kelsey has packed it with genuine terror of the scale I have rarely seen.
