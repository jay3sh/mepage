Elon Musk quote
===
Some original thoughts I've heard about running a company (from the latest [Elon Musk interview][0])  
  

> I run both \[electric car company\] Tesla ([TSLA][1]) and SpaceX myself. It's a heavy workload, and I've never really wanted to run companies. Unfortunately, I came to the conclusion I was better than the CEOs we hired. If I'm not CEO, I can't make the inventions happen in the way they need to happen. Professional managers---MBA CEOs---are not very creative or adaptable, and their skills don't suit a startup. Business is like a multidimensional probabilistic chessboard. The rules aren't set, and the same moves don't always make you win. A lot of people can be really good in a set-piece battle; my biggest differentiating skill is I can invent new pieces.

When you think you are better than others, admit it.
