"OSiM'08 Berlin, Germany"
===
If you remember my posts \[[1][0],[2][1]\] from OSiM'08 USA in San Francisco back in March, here is an update for you.  
  
The March conference in SFO was the first one of OSiM's in US. However they have been active in Europe for some time now. On September 17-18 of this year they will have the 3rd annual conference at Berlin, Germany.  
  
One thing to note about it: For next 3 months the conference will be publishing a blog. .... and I will be running [it][2]. :)
