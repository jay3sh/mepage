What I read...
===
Recently I have been reading news/blogs through many different channels - Google Alerts, Google Reader, digg, del.icio.us, slashdot, plus website hopping. So when I try to recall where did I read particular piece of news, very likely I don't recall. That's what happened today at a friend's place.  
  
But still I will keep using them...  
  
I have added a new window on this blog page in the right panel - titled 'What I read ...'. This is Google Reader's cool (this adjective is now a cliche when used with Google) tool, which will post some top N blog posts that I decide to share from my Google Reader. So you can read what I like to read. ... just another way to solve the problem I mentioned before.
