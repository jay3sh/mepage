Inkface v0.1
===
After spending about a month on bug fixes and writing python bindings, Inkface v0.1 is ready. Check out the video that demonstrates two applications written in Inkface framework. The video also shows how the GUI is designed in Inkscape and how to get the app running with few lines of python code.  
  
  
  
If you want to try these applications yourself:  

* Install the .deb packages ([libaltsvg][0], [inkface-python][1])
* Download python scripts and GUI SVG images: Keyboard ([.py][2] [.svg][3]) IRC ([.py][4] [.svg][5])  

    # Install Inkface libraries  
    dpkg -i libaltsvg_0.1.0_armel.deb inkface-python_0.1.0_armel.deb  
      
    # Keyboard demo  
    python inkface-keyboard.py keyboard-entry.svg  
      
    # IRC demo  
    python inkface-irc.py irc.svg  
    

  
Check out the [project wiki][6] for future plans of the project. It has some notes to get you started. A look into simple python scripts mentioned above will also help.  
  
Here is my last month's [post][7] that discusses the idea behind the project.
