"coding Monalisa"
===
Few days back I met an old friend of mine. He is an architect by profession. It didn't take long for the chats to turn philosophical or artistic. I ended up explaining him about my profession. About the school of thought that computer programming is an art and not dry science. How things are in the computer industry when seen from an artist's point of view. I gave him an hypothetical analogy to explain my point. After few days it occurred to me, that could be a topic for this blog....  
  
... If computer programming is an art then how will Monalisa be painted in a software company ...  
  
There will have to be a demand for Monalisa's portrait. In fact variety of people will have differing views of what Monalisa should look. So they will summon Leonardo for doing the task. Leonardo will have to find a common set of specifications that would help him visualize the beautiful Monalisa. Leonardo will then recruit 5 programmers to work on the masterpiece. Everyone will have to be a team player so that all the different parts of portrait will fit together in harmony. To enusure that, Leonardo as the project lead, will have to take periodic meetings of all artists...  
  
... After spending a quarter working on the project, an alpha portrait of Monalisa will get ready. At this point Leonardo will have to hire 2-3 more people who will make sure that the portrait meets all the viewing needs that it was originally designed for. They will look at the portrait from many angles to make sure that it is as per the original specs.
