"ReaderScope v1.3 - Beyond Google Reader"
===
Google Reader gives us _choice_ in News Reading. With the advent of RSS aggregators, we got the power to subscribe to selective sources of news. That way we can fetch the up-to-date information from the selective sources that we prefer. This saves us time. We build a focused channel to acquire our daily diet of news. 

  
However there is a flip side to that. What if an important news is unrolling that is outside the scope of our news channel. It's being reported by a publisher that we are not subscribed to. In that case we miss out the hotness of a news. 

  
What if after the same routine of reading your regular list of feeds, you get bored. You miss that element of surprise that one gets by reading random headlines. 

  
For the times like this, ReaderScope v1.3 introduces some new features that go beyond Google Reader.

  
You can now read "Google News" in a separate tab, alongside Google Reader feeds. The tab lists six different categories of news: Headlines, World News, Sports, Entertainment, Business, Sci/Tech. You can now stay up-to-date with the latest happenings in any of these areas.

In addition to that, ReaderScope now offers the latest Google Reader feature: "Popular Items". As the [official Google Reader Blog][1] says:

  
> We use algorithms to find top-rising images, videos and pages from anywhere (not just your subscriptions), collect them in the new Popular items section and order them by what we think you'll like best. Now you don't have to be embarrassed about missing that hilarious video everyone is talking about --- it should show up in your "Popular items" feed automatically.

Now you can access the same list from ReaderScope.

In addition, you can now access other lists that were absent in ReaderScope untils now: "All Items", "Starred", "Shared". 

  
You may feel that there is not enough space on screen for all this stuff. If you feel so, you can customize the elements to get more space. The tab panel that lets you choose between Google news and Reader, disappears automatically as you start browsing the news. In the Google Reader's feed list, if you don't want the extra labels, just go to "Settings -\> Customize Layout" and you will be able to rearrange all of them.

  
And yes, ReaderScope is now Android 1.6 ready - for bigger and smaller screens.

  
So update your copy and enjoy!
