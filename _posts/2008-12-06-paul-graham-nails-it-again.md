"Paul Graham nails it again!"
===
Paul Graham published a new essay today "Could VC be a Casualty of the Recession?" It is one of those awesome ones. The best part of the essay is this:  

> ... it has gotten much  
> cheaper to start a startup. There are four main reasons: Moore's  
> law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free;  
> the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful  
> programming languages mean development teams can be smaller.  
> 

All the thoughts on my mind these days, couldn't be summarized better. Check out the full [essay][0], as usual his opinions are radical yet convincing.
