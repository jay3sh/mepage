Insanity and Software
===

“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.” - Einstein (possibly misattributed)

This is a sound judgement when talking about real world. Yet, it doesn't apply to the virtual world created by computing devices. Windows users are quite familiar to the notion of software errors disappearing just by trying the same thing over and over again by restarting the application or even rebooting the machine. It's so common that it's not even funny (or [maybe it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UT8RkSmN4k)).

It's not unreasonable behavior on the part of users of software systems. The software systems do give different results even when the user performs the same set of actions in the same sequence. Why is that?

The interface that the software is creating for its users, is an abstraction of a functionality that the user wants to use. This abstraction is created by an intricate system of technical things underneath. For instance, a desktop operating system like Windows offers a file explorer to the user. A user may try to move a file from one folder to another by drag-n-drop. Sometimes he/she tries this, the file moves instantaneously. At other times it may take half a minute. At some other times, it will completely freeze the computer. In cases like this "turning it on-off" and trying the same things again will likely solve the user's problem. 

The reason for such differences in behavior of the operating system lies in its internals. Sometimes when the user is performing the above operation, the operating system might be running a defragmentation routine, causing delay in the file transfer. At other times another background program might have filled the hard drive almost full, unknown to the user; thus leading to freezing of the desktop. Thus the software systems fall short in creating a consistent world (the way real world is consistent to our daily experience). Therefore the above definition of Insanity doesn't apply to software users.
