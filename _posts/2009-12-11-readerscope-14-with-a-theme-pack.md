"ReaderScope 1.4 (with a Theme Pack)"

Yes, now you don't have to stare at the black and khaki interface of ReaderScope. With 1.4, ReaderScope adds a theme pack. Right now it comes with three themes which look far more pleasant than the legacy color scheme. Also the Theme Pack is the first premium add-on to ReaderScope. You can buy it for only $3.49, from [here][0]. You can see the preview in the Theme switcher, just go to _Settings -\> Themes_.

In future more themes will be added to the theme pack and you can get access to all of them, for just $3.49\.  
  
Go on, give it a try.
