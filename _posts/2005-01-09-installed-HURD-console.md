Installed HURD console
===

Yesterday I installed console on my GNU/HURD setup. It's very cool. It lets me switch between number of terminals even in command line interface. Never seen this thing in command line. The installation was straighforward as pointed [here](http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view/Hurd/HurdConsole). 

Later I tried to make XFree86 work on my system referring to [this post](http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view/Hurd/Xfree86). But no luck with that yet. I don't understand how to tackle the dependency problem while installing the required packages for XFree86, namely x-window-system-core and others listed. 

Later on I also tried to setup network connection. But it is giving me errors like 

    /hurd/pfinet: eth0: (os/device) no such device 

Will do some googling on these issues today.
