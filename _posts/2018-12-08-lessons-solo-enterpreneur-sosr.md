[WIP] Lessons for Solo Enterpreneur from "Structure of Scientific Revolutions"
===

Thomas Kuhn's "Structure of Scientific Revolutions" is a classic book in philosophy of Science. When I recently finished reading it, I developed the understanding of Scientific research in a way that I hadn't before imagined. However the way he modeled Scientific research, also helped me make sense of the difficulties I was facing as Solo enterpreneur.

Here's a short summary of the ideas in this book that are relevant to this topic. SOSR categorizes all the scientific research into two types - Normal science and Revolutions. Normal science is what most of the research that we know. Revolutions on the other hand happen rarely and they define new Paradigms that change the way scientists look at the problems. The examples of this are the theories developed by Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Maxwell, in their respective fields and times. The book elaborates on the nature of each kind of research and why each are inevitable.

A very novel understanding is developed when you read about the author's justification of Normal science, which almost sounds like Orwellian beuraucracy which actively tries to discourage new ideas - because that will be harmful to Science!
