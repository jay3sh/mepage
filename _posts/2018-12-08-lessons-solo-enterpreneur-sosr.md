Lessons for Game designers from "Structure of Scientific Revolutions"
===

Thomas Kuhn's "Structure of Scientific Revolutions" is a classic book in philosophy of Science. When I recently finished reading it, I developed the understanding of Scientific research in a way that I hadn't before imagined. However the way he modeled Scientific research, also helped me make sense of the difficulties I was facing as Game designer. These difficulties were related to artistic side of game design, rather than technical.

Here's a short summary of the ideas in this book that are relevant to this topic. SOSR categorizes all the scientific research into two types - Normal science and Revolutions. 

**Normal science** is what most of the research that we know. SOSR defines it as *research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying foundation for its further practice*.

**Revolutions** on the other hand happen rarely and they define new Paradigms that change the way scientists look at the problems. The examples of this are the theories developed by Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Maxwell, in their respective fields and times. The book elaborates on the nature of each kind of research and why each are inevitable.

Determine which game to make is a very difficult question, especially when it's also supposed to be your principal source of income. You want to make a game that satisfies many constraints, for e.g.

* It should be enjoyable to make
* It should be enjoyable to play (by you and others)
* It should be within the scope of your capabilities (technical/artistic)
* If you need outside help (technical/artistic) it should be within your financial budget
* It should generate revenue (i.e. it's marketable, not too niche)
* It should achieve some higher level goal/principle that gives meaning to your work

In my past 3 years as solo enterpreneur I've evaluated all my project ideas on these criteria before I start pursuing them single-mindedly. These criteria were not so clear in the beginning, but in recent times I've managed to develop this framework of thinking. The lessons learnt from SOSR further helped refine this process for me.

The above listed criteria are not entirely independent. When I'm in the phase of choosing next project, I'll start working on some idea that fits some of the above constraints; but after spending few weeks it would start violating one of the remaining constraints. This would slowly (or all of a sudden) make me loose interest in that idea. This can be very frustrating, because the time and efforts spent on that idea seems to have gone waste. (I would later realize that it's not total waste, because the skills learnt were a great assets for future). It becomes quite depressing when this cycle repeats many times (in last such phase I went though 6-8 such cycles in span of 2-3 months). You don't have anything tangible to show for all these efforts and it all seems to be an excercise in futility.

However in past 3 years, I've also had periods of time when I am not facing such uncertainty. This is the period when I've committed to a single project. I've no doubt that the project will be successful when finished (which doesn't turn out to be completely true at the end, but it creates positive belief in future and helps focus on work at hand). In such times, I am free to dig deeper into the implementation of the project. In this phase, I can face any design challenges or technical difficulties even if they appear huge and little outside my reach. I could break them down, analyse them closely and come up with a workable solution. This requires patient and persistent efforts. The kind of self-doubt or skepticism towards the project idea that I have before I'm committed to it is absent in this phase. If it weren't, I won't be able to focus on difficult problems like this.

I found these two phases in my work to be very similar to the **Revolutions** and **Normal Science** phases in scientific ventures. Of course the scale of the scope is different.
