"Clutter Webkit"
===
Finally I got it working last night.  
  
  
  
After watching the demo of clutter at [OSiM][0] I got interested in the [OpenedHand][1]'s [Clutter][2] project. More importantly embedding a browser in cairo is of greater interest to me. So when I got it working, I couldn't help showing it off.
