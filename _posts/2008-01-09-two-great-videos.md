"two great videos"
===
Today I saw two amazing videos reported on slashdot.  
  
The [first][0] video is about a french radio operator who makes his own vacuum tubes. This 17-min video is a magic show for a geek. It shows a rare phenomenon when engineering meets craftsmanship. I have always had tough time getting success in hardware projects, so I turned into a software guy over time. That's why I started envying this guy, because there is hardly anything that a software guy can show in a video that will demonstrate the abstractions he visualizes and expresses in his programs.  
  
That's when I saw this [second][1] video that shows an analysis of the assembly code that explains the IGMP buffer overflow in Windows kernel. I didn't understand a lot of it, but I liked the way this video helps one visualize the molecular structure of a software program, what we otherwise call assembly code.  
  
  
Enjoy!
