Cutewit (preview)
===
This blog has been quiet lately despite all the things I have to share. The main culprit is Twitter. Everything there is to share, trickles away 140 characters a time and nothing is left for a long blog post.  
  
Well, here is an update. I spent the last month applying all the ideas from the inkface library to the Android platform. During the exercise I have written an Android App - a Twitter client - [Cutewit][0]. Few hours ago I uploaded a preview version of the app, to Android market and [SlideMe][1]. Here are some screenshots:  
  
  
  
All the GUI was developed in Inkscape as SVG images. The app lacks many features, but they will soon be coming in the 1.0 release.  
  
If you have Android phone, give it a shot. Even if you don't have a phone (not unlike me) you can still try it in Android emulator that's part of the SDK. I myself plan to use it as a desktop app, running in the emulator window.  
  
That's all for now... follow me on twitter (@jyro) if you are interested in updates.
