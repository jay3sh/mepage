"The Gods Themselves by Isaac Asimov"
===
[![The Gods Themselves](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C9NNP0FKL._SX106_.jpg)][0][The Gods Themselves][0] by [Isaac Asimov][1]  
  
My rating: [5 of 5 stars][2]  
  
I started reading this book, when I found that it was a Hugo award winner and I was looking for some intellectually entertaining science fiction. It didn't disappoint me. OTOH it turned out to be one of the best scifi novels I've ever read.  
  
  
It takes real imaginative power and also thorough knowledge of science and technology to weave a story around them. [Asimov][3] has tackled three extremely imaginative topics - Parallel Universes, Procreation that takes 3 individuals of a species instead of 2, Life on Moon - and he has done full justice to each one of them.
